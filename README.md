# Cat-app-and-Coffee-Menu
These projects involved creating a small cafe menu website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I built structured layouts with headings, sections, articles, and lists, styled text with different fonts and sizes, and added images and icons. I also learned to use CSS properties such as margins, padding, colors, and flexbox to align content, center elements, and improve spacing. Additionally, I applied pseudo-classes like :visited and :active for link styling, making the website interactive and visually appealing.

I have completed several beginner-friendly web development projects where I learned to code from scratch, without any prior experience. These projects allowed me to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals, create structured layouts, style content, and build responsive designs. Through hands-on experience, I gained confidence in writing clean code and applying best practices to build functional and visually appealing web pages.
